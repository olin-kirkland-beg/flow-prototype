# Flow Prototype

This is a prototype for a flow-based programming environment. It allows users to create and manipulate data flows using a visual interface. The prototype is built using Vue.js and Vue Flow.

It is designed to export to JSON format, which is then used in the DALI-Sys project in the form of State Machines.

## Installation

To run the prototype locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com-olin-kirkland-beg:olin-kirkland-beg/flow-prototype.git
cd flow-prototype
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port your setup uses).

## Features

- Visual flow creation with Vue Flow
- JSON export for use in DALI-Sys
- Node linking and editing
- Built with Vue 3 + Composition API
